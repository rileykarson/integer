# integer
"integer" is a website I created in order to solve a problem I was having while trying to study or explain concepts in a Computer Architecture course: 32 bits take a long time to write out on a piece of paper! At it's core, it's an interactive way to show what a binary string means, and an easy way to see what flipping individual bits or performing shifts on a 4-byte variable in memory would do.

It supports:
  - Signed (Two's Complement) and Unsigned Modes
  - Displaying the Decimal and Hexadecimal values represented by the Binary string
  - C-like Bit Shifting
